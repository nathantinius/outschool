/*  What we are going to learn: Strings, Variables, Functions */

/*  ðŸ¦Š  Strings are what we call the text elements that we 
        want to use in Software Engineering */
    
"Hello!!" // ðŸš¨ Notice the quotation marks >> " "

/*  ðŸ¦Š  Variables are split into two groups
        const and let.
        
        A const is a constant this means it
        never changes. In computer science this
        is referred to as Immutable.
        
        A let on the otherhand is what is known
        as mutable. This means we can change it
        as we go.
        
        Lets build a few examples.

//  ðŸ›–  Create your const variable and call it "hello"
const hello = "Hello World!";

console.log(hello)

//  ðŸ›–  Create your let variable and call it "name"
let name;

name = "Mr Nathan"
name = "Ms Marquis"

console.log(name);
