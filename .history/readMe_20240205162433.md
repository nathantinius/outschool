# Welcome to Fun with Javascript Adventures

When you start an adventure where should you always start? 

I always like to start by looking at a map. The same is true when you are a Software Engineer. Our map in software engineering is called a Read Me... what do you think we should do with a Read Me file? If you guessed, "Read it," you're right! In the Read Me file below, I'm going to tell you a little about this course.

Let me take a minute to introduce some of my friends that we'll be seeing throughout the code in this course.

### 🚨 Samuel L Siren
Sammy is going to warn you of things that you should watch out for. If you see Sam, we are going to be discussing our most important things. If you're not careful, these mistakes can really come back to haunt you. Speaking of haunting, you should also meet...

### 👻 Gary
As we become better Engineers, Gary is going to start popping up. I am going to give you broken code sometimes and Gary will be there to show you that there is something wrong here. This is where you really want to take a close look at our code. In Engineering we call these mistakes bugs.

### 🐰 Refactor Rebecca
Rebecca is going to show up where our code can be refactored. Refactoring is where we make our code better. There will be times you write code that works but it took more effort than it needed to. We can use refactoring to reduce the amount of effort and still allow our program to work.

### 🦊 Fredrick
Fred is a walking dictionary and he is going to help us understand special vocabulary Engineers use everyday. If you see Fred, get ready to flex your memorization muscles.

### 🛖 Jaba De Hut
When you see the Hut Icon this is you're signal to start typing code. 

### 💣 Da Bomb
When you see the Bomb you want to delete the code below.

I am excited to start this journey with you and become better Software Engineers.
