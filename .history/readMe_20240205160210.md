# Welcome to Fun with Javascript Adventures

When you start an adventure where should you always start? 

I always like to start by looking at a map. The same is true when you are a Software Engineer. Our map in software engineering is called a Read Me... you may be thinking that is a wierd name. I am going to tell you a secret Engineers are a little bit lazy. We get so exited by the idea of coding we will jump in head first. 

Let me take a minute to introduce one of my friends

### üö® Samuel L Siren
Sammy is going to warn you of things that you should watch out for. If you see Sam we are going to discussing be our most important things. If your not careful these mistakes can really comeback to haunt you. Speaking of you should also meet...

### üëª Gary
Gary as we become better Engineers Gary is going to start popping up. I am going to give you broken code sometimes and Gary will be there to show you that there is something wrong here. This is where you really want to take a close look at our code. In Engineering we call these mistakes bugs.

### üê∞ Refactor Rebecca
Rebecca is going to show up where our code can be refactored. Refactoring is where we make our code better. There will be times you write code that works but it took more effort than it needed to. We can use refactoring to reduce the amount of effort and still allow our program to work.

### ü¶ä Fredrick
