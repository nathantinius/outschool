//  Lets make a 'Guess the Number' game in Javascript!

//  Time to get an MVP together
/*  🦊  MVP = A Minimal Viable Product is the base 
        of every application you have ever used. It
        represents the minimum number of components
        needed to make our programs work.

/*  🦊  Comparison & Logical Operators give us the ability 
        to check our values against each other.

console.log(x == x);
console.log(user.length > 3);

console.log(x!=5)
console.log(x===x)
console.log(x!==x)

console.log(!x);
console.log(!!x);





//  🛖  Create a Variable to hold our answer.


//  🛖  Create a function that asks the user for a guess.


//  🛖  Create a check guess function. **Hint use a comparison 
















/*  🐼  Our users have a few requests: 
        
        Can the game have different difficulty levels?
        
        It would be great if our users could challenge
        each other.

        Our users would like to be able to see thier 
        past guesses.
