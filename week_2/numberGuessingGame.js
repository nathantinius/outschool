//  Lets make a 'Guess the Number' game in Javascript!

//  Time to get an MVP together
/*  🦊  MVP = A Minimal Viable Product is the base 
        of every application you have ever used. It
        represents the minimum number of components
        needed to make our programs work. 
*/


/*  🦊  Comparison & Logical Operators give us the ability 
        to check our values against each other.      
*/

/*  🦊  Primative Types tell us what an value IS or what 
        a variable holds
*/

let x;

console.log(x==x);
console.log(x=="hello");
console.log(x==5);
console.log(typeof x);
console.log(typeof 5);
console.log(typeof "hello");

















//  🛖  Create a Variable to hold our answer.

//  🛖  Create a function that asks the user for a guess.

//  🛖  Create a check guess function. **Hint use a comparison 















/*  🐼  Our users have a few requests: 
        
        Can the game have different difficulty levels?
        
        It would be great if our users could challenge
        each other.

        Our users would like to be able to see thier 
        past guesses.
