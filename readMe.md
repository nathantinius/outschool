# Welcome to Fun with Javascript Adventures
Let me take a minute to introduce some of my friends that we'll be seeing throughout the code in this course.

### 🚨 Samuel L Siren
Sammy is going to warn you of things that you should watch out for. If you see Sam, we are going to be discussing our most important things. If you're not careful, these mistakes can really come back to bug you. Speaking of bug, you should also meet...

### 🪲 Bugsworth
As we become better Engineers, Bugsworth is going to start popping up. I am going to give you broken code sometimes and Bugsworth will be there to show you that there is something wrong here. This is where you really want to take a close look at our code. In Engineering we call these mistakes bugs.

### 🐼 Penny
Penny is our Project Manager and she is going to tell us about new features and client requests.

### 🦊 Fredrick
Fred is a walking dictionary and he is going to help us understand special vocabulary Engineers use everyday. If you see Fred, get ready to flex your memorization muscles.

### 🛖 Jaba De Hut
When you see the Hut Icon this is you're signal to start typing code. 

### 💣 Da Bomb
When you see the Bomb you want to delete the code below.

I am excited to start this journey with you and become better Software Engineers.
